This is a solo project I did on Scrimba.

Requirements were to build a basketball scoreboard, and the requirements were:
- Build it from "scratch"
- Following the design provided on Figma (https://www.figma.com/file/YC48MCx4frBFtYoz6rNJE6/Basketball-- Scoreboard?node-id=0-1&t=WZp44QKDeVEoafk2-0)
- Make all the buttons work

Strech goals completed:
